        <h1>Week1-4</h1>
        <h3>Week1</h3>
        <p>This week is the first week of this semester, In this week we are focusing 
            on software which is call eclipse, which is an IDE for computer programming,
            which contain many functions. I am going to use this environment to finish 
            my project this year.</p>
        <h3>Week2</h3>
        <p>This week I tried different kinds of programming, writing a circle, taichi 
            and knowing what is canvas, canvas is just a widget to show what you have 
            written. After that, I tried to draw a class table, for easier understanding.</p>
        <h3>Week3</h3>
        <p>This week we focus more on theory instead of writing code, I know more 
            about Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), Polymorphism, inheritance and 
            Encapsulation. In python, we heavily rely on OOP to write, that why 
            people say it becomes easy to use.</p>
        <h3>Week4</h3>
        <p>This week I install XAMPP to learn how to use CGI, which is an interface 
            for the program to generate the internet, after installing XAMPP and put 
            the .py code in the folder we may see our code on the internet. I 
            think is good to see the program and test it.</p>
