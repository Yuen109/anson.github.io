        <h1>week5-8</h1>
        <h3>Week5</h3>
        <p>In week 5, I try to do the sorting which is call bubblesort(), this sorting is written by ourselves and with a little difference to the sorting provided by python. Bubblesort() is a simple way to write a sorting in the program. </p>
        <h3>Week6</h3>
        <p>In week 6, I am working on the student class, it is to create student object and can be used in the next time. In the class, __str__() is the method to print out the statement by just calling __str__() in the program. We must see this method in every class in python. Also, we try to use XML to get the exchange rate on the internet, I am trying to work XML in the group project as well.</p>
        <h3>Wweek7</h3>
        <p>This week, we do more lab and I think the lab is going harder and more challenging, first recursive function in power is fair to me, when it goes to Caesar Cipher it becomes hard to understand,  it changes the letter to another letter by increasing three integers, of course, we do a lot of testing in this programming to get a correct answer.</p>
        <h3>Week8</h3>
        <p>This week, we also using class to create a point, the point is to create the triangle, which includes three points and a mid-point to create a 5 level of Sierpinski Triangle, I think it is quite challenging to write the code  </p>
