        <h3>self-introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This course is helping me to understand what is coding. As I am a 
            beginner having no fundamental basis is hard and way too demanding, this 
            course helping me to gain a lot of experiences because the exercise and 
            project are so true to be seen.

        <h3>My background</h3><br>
            Hi, I am Anson Yuen a student study in scope, I am now studying 
            Information Technology for Business. This website will cocer my 3 years 
            programme in scope.
        </p>
        <p>Course name: <a href="https://www.scope.edu/Home/Programmes/BachelorsDegree3-Year/Programmes/BScHonsInformationTechnologyforBusiness.aspx">BSC(Hons) Information Technology for Business</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This course helps me to know more about what is happening in the 
            IT world, teaches me how to code, it combines business in programming and 
            programming can help lower the time cost in business which make the business process more efficient. 

            <br>As I want to be a white hacker or a data scientist in the business industry, 
            some skills like writing a loan table and testing is a good chance for me to have a 
            try work like one of them. I think this course has a lot of time is do self-learning I will read more about testing and most importantly think like a programmer.
