        <h1>week9-12</h1>
        <h3>Week9</h3>
        <p>This week we focus on practice using class, this time using Client class to create client, it represents each customer object. In the class, we try to raise error and except them so the program can continuously run. Also is find this part most challenging and hard.</p>
        <h3>Week10</h3>
        <p>This week I learn doctest and unittest, these two kinds of testing have their own advantages, for doctest it checks the documentation base on the code, for unittest it checks the component of the code, class and functions.</p>
        <h3>Week11</h3>
        <p>This week I learn how to use git to clone, add, push. So git is used to version control and collaborate with teammates, it is commonly used in the IT world too. Moreover this week I am focusing more on the project that soon been hand in which is grade.py and student121.py.</p>
        <h3>Week12</h3>
        <p>In the last week, we hand in all the project and in the last lesson we are going to have a test on what we have learned, this mc test is quite complex, it covers almost all the things I have learned.</p>
